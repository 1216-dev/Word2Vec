# Word2Vec
The goal of this project is to create word embeddings using the Word2Vec model with Gensim and use these embeddings in machine learning tasks such as text classification, clustering, or sentiment analysis. The project demonstrates how to build word embeddings from a corpus and how to use these embeddings as input to a machine learning model.
